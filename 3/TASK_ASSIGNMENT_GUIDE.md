### ‚è∞ **Event-Driven Deadlines**
- **Fixed Deadlines**: Traditional date/time deadlines
- **Event-Based Deadlines**: Deadlines calculated from event triggers
- **Flexible Deadlines**: Tasks without strict deadlines
- Automatic recalculation when events change

### üîî **Smart Notifications**

## Database Schema

The system adds 6 new tables to the existing database:

### 1. `tasks` - Main task information
```sql
- id (UUID, Primary Key)
- title, description, priority, status
- deadline_type ('fixed', 'event_based', 'flexible')
- fixed_deadline, event_trigger, deadline_offset_days
- deadline_calculated (computed from events)
- dependencies, tags, task_data (JSONB)
```

### 2. `task_assignments` - User-task relationships
```sql
- task_id, user_id (composite key)
- status ('assigned', 'accepted', 'declined', 'completed')
- progress_percentage, time_logged, notes
```

### 3. `deadline_events` - Event triggers
```sql
- event_name (unique)
- event_date, event_data, is_active
```

### 4. `task_deadline_history` - Deadline change tracking
```sql
- task_id, old_deadline, new_deadline
- change_reason, changed_by, changed_at
```

### 5. `task_notifications` - User notifications
```sql
- task_id, user_id, notification_type
- message, is_read, sent_at, read_at
```

## Usage Examples

### Creating Tasks

#### 1. Fixed Deadline Task
```python
task_data = {
    "title": "Complete volunteer background check",
    "description": "Submit required documents",
    "priority": 3,  # 1=low, 2=medium, 3=high, 4=urgent
    "category": "Onboarding",
    "deadline_type": "fixed",
    "fixed_deadline": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "estimated_hours": 2.0,
    "tags": ["background-check", "required"]
}
# POST /api/tasks
```

#### 2. Event-Based Deadline Task
```python
task_data = {
    "title": "Set up event registration booth",
    "description": "Prepare registration materials and booth setup",
    "priority": 2,
    "category": "Event Preparation", 
    "deadline_type": "event_based",
    "event_trigger": "community_fair_start",
    "deadline_offset_days": -1,  # 1 day before event
    "estimated_hours": 3.0,
    "tags": ["setup", "registration"]
}
```

#### 3. Flexible Deadline Task
```python
task_data = {
    "title": "Review volunteer handbook",
    "description": "Familiarize yourself with policies and procedures",
    "priority": 1,
    "category": "Training",
    "deadline_type": "flexible",  # No strict deadline
    "estimated_hours": 1.5,
    "tags": ["handbook", "self-paced"]
}
```

### Creating Deadline Events
```python
event_data = {
    "event_name": "summer_camp_2025",
    "event_date": "2025-06-15T08:00:00Z",
    "event_data": {
        "location": "Blue Ash YMCA",
        "participants": 150,
        "duration_weeks": 8
    }
}
# POST /api/deadline-events
```

When this event is created/updated, all tasks with `event_trigger="summer_camp_2025"` will have their deadlines automatically recalculated.

### Updating Task Progress
```python
progress_data = {
    "progress": 75,
    "status": "in_progress", 
    "notes": "Background check submitted, awaiting approval",
    "time_logged": 1.5
}
# PUT /api/tasks/{task_id}
```

## Event-Driven Deadline System

### How It Works
1. **Event Creation**: Define events that can trigger deadlines
   ```python
   # Event: Project kickoff meeting
   event_date = "2025-02-01T09:00:00Z"
   ```

2. **Task Creation**: Create tasks with event-based deadlines
   ```python
   # Task: Prepare meeting materials
   # Due 2 days BEFORE project kickoff
   deadline_offset_days = -2
   ```

3. **Automatic Calculation**: System calculates actual deadline
   ```
   Event Date: 2025-02-01T09:00:00Z
   Offset: -2 days
   Calculated Deadline: 2025-01-30T09:00:00Z
   ```

4. **Event Updates**: If event date changes, all related task deadlines update automatically
   ```python
   # Event moved to Feb 5th
   # Task deadline automatically becomes Jan 3rd
   ```

### Common Event Types
- `volunteer_training_complete` - After training completion
- `project_kickoff` - Project start dates
- `event_start` - Community events, camps, programs
- `registration_deadline` - Registration cutoffs
- `facility_booking` - Facility reservation dates

## Notification System

### Notification Types
- `deadline_approaching` - 24 hours before deadline
- `overdue` - Task past deadline
- `assignment_new` - New task assigned
- `status_change` - Task status updated
- `deadline_change` - Event caused deadline change

### Automatic Notifications
The system automatically sends notifications for:
- Tasks due within 24 hours
- Overdue tasks (daily reminders)
- New task assignments
- Deadline changes from event updates

## Task Dashboard

Each user gets a comprehensive dashboard showing:

```json
{
  "user_id": "user-uuid",
  "stats": {
    "total_tasks": 12,
    "pending_tasks": 3,
    "in_progress_tasks": 5,
    "completed_tasks": 4,
    "overdue_tasks": 1,
    "due_soon_tasks": 2
  },
  "tasks": [...], // Full task list
  "tasks_by_priority": {
    "urgent": [...],
    "high": [...],
    "medium": [...],
    "low": [...]
  },
  "notifications": [...] // Unread notifications
}
```

## Analytics

### System Analytics
```json
{
  "total_tasks": 156,
  "completion_rate": 0.73,
  "average_completion_time": 2.4,
  "tasks_by_status": {
    "completed": 114,
    "in_progress": 28,
    "pending": 14
  },
  "overdue_count": 8
}
```

### User Analytics
Track individual volunteer performance and engagement.

## Integration with YMCA System

The task system integrates seamlessly with existing volunteer management:

### 1. Volunteer Onboarding
```python
# Create onboarding tasks automatically when volunteer signs up
tasks = [
    "Complete background check",
    "Attend orientation session", 
    "Review safety procedures",
    "Complete required training"
]
```

### 2. Event Preparation
```python
# Create event-based tasks tied to camp/program dates
# Tasks automatically get proper deadlines
```

### 3. Ongoing Volunteer Management
```python
# Regular tasks for active volunteers
# Deadline monitoring ensures nothing falls through cracks
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test script:
```bash
python test_task_system.py
```

This demonstrates:
- Task creation with different deadline types
- Event-driven deadline recalculation
- Progress tracking and notifications
- User dashboard functionality
- Analytics reporting

## Production Deployment

### 1. Database Setup
Run the SQL commands from `database.py` to create the required tables in your Supabase instance.

### 2. Environment Variables
Ensure these are configured:
```env
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY=your_service_key
```

### 3. Task Scheduler
In production, run the deadline monitoring in a separate process:
```python
# Background task scheduler
task_scheduler = TaskScheduler(task_manager)
asyncio.create_task(task_scheduler.start())
```

### 4. API Integration
The task management endpoints are automatically included when you start the FastAPI application.

## Best Practices

### 1. Event Naming
Use consistent, descriptive event names:
- `summer_camp_2025_start`
- `volunteer_training_march_completion`
- `facility_maintenance_window`

### 2. Task Categories
Organize tasks with clear categories:
- "Onboarding"
- "Training" 
- "Event Preparation"
- "Maintenance"
- "Documentation"

### 3. Priority Levels
- **Urgent (4)**: Safety-critical or time-sensitive
- **High (3)**: Important deadlines, required tasks
- **Medium (2)**: Regular tasks, moderate importance
- **Low (1)**: Nice-to-have, flexible timing

### 4. Deadline Offsets
Plan appropriate lead times:
- Training completion: -7 days before event
- Material preparation: -3 days before event  
- Setup tasks: -1 day before event

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Tasks not getting calculated deadlines**
   - Ensure event exists with matching `event_name`
   - Check event `is_active = true`
   - Verify `deadline_type = 'event_based'`

2. **Notifications not sending**
   - Check task has assigned users
   - Verify deadline is within notification window
   - Ensure user has valid user_id

3. **Dashboard not loading**
   - Confirm user exists in users table
   - Check task assignments are properly linked

### Debug Endpoints
- `GET /health` - System health check
- `POST /api/tasks/check-deadlines` - Manual deadline check
- `GET /api/tasks/analytics` - System analytics
