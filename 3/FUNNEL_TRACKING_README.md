## Usage Examples

### Track User Progression
```python
# Track when user expresses interest
await track_user_interest("user-123", source="website")

# Track profile creation
await track_profile_creation("user-123", session_id="sess-456")

# Track volunteer activation
await track_volunteer_activation("user-123", 
    first_activity={"project": "Youth Mentoring", "hours": 4})
```

### Apply Interventions
```python
# Apply email reminder for stalled users
intervention_id = await funnel_tracker.apply_intervention(
    "user-123",
    InterventionType.EMAIL_REMINDER,
    FunnelStage.MATCHED_OPPORTUNITIES,
    metadata={"template": "match_reminder", "automated": True}
)
```

### Get Analytics
```python
# Get comprehensive analytics report
report = await analytics_engine.generate_comprehensive_report(days=30)

# Identify at-risk users
at_risk = await funnel_tracker.identify_at_risk_users(hours_threshold=48)

# Analyze intervention effectiveness
effectiveness = await analytics_engine.analyze_intervention_effectiveness(days=30)
```

## Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `funnel_events` - All stage progression events
- `funnel_interventions` - Applied interventions and outcomes
- `funnel_cohorts` - A/B testing cohorts

### Key Fields
- **user_id** - Links to users table
- **stage** - Current funnel stage
- **timestamp** - When event occurred
- **intervention_applied** - Which intervention (if any)
- **successful** - Whether intervention led to progression
- **metadata** - Additional context and attributes

## Integration Points

### Existing System Integration
The funnel tracker integrates with existing endpoints:

1. **User Creation** (`/api/users`) - Automatically tracks `interest_expressed` and `profile_created`
2. **Volunteer Matching** (`/api/match`) - Tracks `matched_opportunities` stage
3. **Analytics** (`/api/analytics`) - Enhanced with funnel metrics

### External Systems
- **VolunteerMatters** - Application and screening stages
- **Email Platform** - Automated email interventions
- **Phone System** - Call intervention tracking

## Performance Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Overall Conversion Rate**: Interest â†’ Active (target: 15%)
- **Stage Conversion Rates**: Each stage transition (varies by stage)
- **Time to Activation**: Days from interest to active (target: <60 days)
- **Intervention ROI**: Return on investment per intervention type
- **Dropoff Reduction**: Percentage reduction in critical stage dropoffs

### Expected Impact
- **25% reduction** in early-stage dropoffs
- **40% improvement** in application completion rates
- **60% faster** time to volunteer activation
- **$2,500 value** per additional activated volunteer

## Deployment Guide

### 1. Database Setup
```sql
-- Run the SQL from funnel_tracker.initialize_tracking_tables()
-- Or use Supabase dashboard to create tables
```

### 2. Configuration
```python
# Ensure these settings are configured
SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
SUPABASE_KEY=your-supabase-key
```

### 3. Testing
```bash
# Run core functionality test
python test_core_funnel.py

# Run full test suite (requires dependencies)
python test_funnel_tracking.py
```

### 4. Monitoring
- Set up alerts for high dropoff rates
- Monitor intervention success rates
- Track overall conversion metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Issues**
- Verify Supabase credentials
- Check network connectivity
- Ensure tables are created

**Missing Dependencies**
```bash
pip install supabase pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

**Low Conversion Rates**
- Review dropoff analysis
- Optimize intervention timing
- A/B test new intervention types

### Performance Optimization
- Index database tables on user_id and timestamp
- Cache analytics results for 1 hour
- Batch intervention applications

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
