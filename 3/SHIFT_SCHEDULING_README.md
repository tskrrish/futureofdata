# Advanced Shift Scheduling System

This document describes the advanced shift scheduling system that has been integrated into the YMCA Volunteer PathFinder AI Assistant. The system provides comprehensive scheduling capabilities with constraint validation, skill matching, and automated optimization.

## Features

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Employee Management**: Track employees with skills, certifications, and availability
- **Role-Based Scheduling**: Define roles with specific skill and certification requirements  
- **Shift Management**: Create and manage shifts with time, location, and staffing requirements
- **Constraint Validation**: Enforce work hour limits, break requirements, and custom constraints
- **Automated Optimization**: Intelligent assignment algorithm that maximizes satisfaction while respecting constraints
- **Break Enforcement**: Automatic validation of break requirements between shifts

### ✅ Advanced Features
- **Skill-Level Matching**: Match employees to roles based on skill levels (Beginner → Expert)
- **Preference Scoring**: Consider employee preferences for shift types and days
- **Workload Balancing**: Distribute work fairly among employees
- **Constraint Management**: Custom constraints per employee (max hours, break times, etc.)
- **Real-time Validation**: Validate assignments before they're made
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Comprehensive reporting on schedules, utilization, and compliance

## System Components

### 1. Data Models (`models.py`)

#### Employee
Represents a worker with skills, availability, and constraints:
```python
Employee(
    id="emp_001",
    first_name="Alice",
    last_name="Johnson", 
    email="alice@ymca.org",
    skills={"customer_service": SkillLevel.EXPERT},
    certifications=["CPR", "First Aid"],
    max_hours_per_day=8.0,
    available_days=["monday", "tuesday", "wednesday"]
)
```

#### Role
Defines position requirements:
```python
Role(
    id="lifeguard",
    name="Lifeguard",
    required_skills={"swimming": SkillLevel.INTERMEDIATE},
    required_certifications=["Lifeguard", "CPR"]
)
```

#### Shift
Represents a work period:
```python
Shift(
    id="morning_shift_001",
    date=datetime(2024, 3, 18),
    start_time=time(6, 0),
    end_time=time(14, 0),
    role=lifeguard_role,
    required_employees=2
)
```

### 2. Constraint Validation (`shift_constraints.py`)

The `ConstraintValidator` class enforces all scheduling rules:

- **Shift Capacity**: Ensures shifts don't exceed maximum employee limits
- **Employee Availability**: Validates employees are available on requested days/times
- **Role Requirements**: Confirms employees meet skill and certification requirements
- **Work Hour Limits**: Enforces daily and weekly hour maximums
- **Break Requirements**: Validates minimum time between shifts
- **Schedule Conflicts**: Prevents double-booking employees
- **Custom Constraints**: Supports additional per-employee rules

### 3. Scheduling Algorithm (`shift_scheduler.py`)

The `ShiftScheduler` uses a two-phase optimization approach:

#### Phase 1: Greedy Initial Assignment
- Prioritizes high-priority shifts
- Considers role difficulty (skill requirements)
- Makes initial assignments based on best-fit scoring

#### Phase 2: Local Search Optimization  
- Attempts reassignment of unassigned shifts
- Tries beneficial swaps between employees
- Balances workload across the team
- Iterative improvement until convergence

#### Scoring System
Each potential assignment gets scored on:
- **Skill Match** (40%): How well employee skills match role requirements
- **Employee Preference** (25%): Alignment with preferred shift types and days
- **Workload Balance** (20%): Helps distribute work evenly
- **Schedule Continuity** (15%): Considers existing schedule patterns

### 4. REST API (`shift_api.py`)

Comprehensive API endpoints for all operations:

## Usage Examples

### 1. Creating a Complete Schedule

```python
from datetime import datetime, time
from models import Employee, Role, Shift, Schedule, SkillLevel, ShiftType

# Create employees
alice = Employee(
    id="emp_001",
    first_name="Alice", 
    last_name="Johnson",
    email="alice@ymca.org",
    skills={"customer_service": SkillLevel.EXPERT},
    max_hours_per_week=40.0
)

# Create role
front_desk_role = Role(
    id="front_desk",
    name="Front Desk Associate",
    required_skills={"customer_service": SkillLevel.INTERMEDIATE}
)

# Create shift
morning_shift = Shift(
    id="shift_001",
    date=datetime(2024, 3, 18),
    start_time=time(6, 0),
    end_time=time(14, 0),
    role=front_desk_role,
    location="Main Lobby",
    shift_type=ShiftType.MORNING
)

# Create schedule
schedule = Schedule(
    id="weekly_001",
    name="Week of March 18th",
    start_date=datetime(2024, 3, 18),
    end_date=datetime(2024, 3, 24),
    employees=[alice],
    shifts=[morning_shift]
)
```

### 2. Running Optimization

```python
from shift_scheduler import ShiftScheduler

scheduler = ShiftScheduler()
result = scheduler.optimize_schedule(schedule, max_iterations=1000)

if result.success:
    print(f"Optimization completed in {result.execution_time:.2f}s")
    print(f"Score: {result.optimization_score:.3f}")
    print(f"Unassigned shifts: {len(result.unassigned_shifts)}")
else:
    print("Optimization failed:", result.message)
```

### 3. Validating Individual Assignments

```python
from shift_constraints import ConstraintValidator

validator = ConstraintValidator()
result = validator.validate_shift_assignment(schedule, "emp_001", "shift_001")

if result.success:
    print("Assignment is valid")
else:
    print("Assignment blocked:")
    for violation in result.violations:
        print(f"  - {violation}")
```
