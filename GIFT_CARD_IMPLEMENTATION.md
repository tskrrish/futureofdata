# Gift Card Redemption Feature Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive points redemption system for third-party gift cards to the YMCA volunteer tracking application. Volunteers can now exchange their earned points (based on volunteer hours) for gift cards from popular retailers.

## Features Implemented

### Backend API (FastAPI)
1. **Gift Card Models and Enums**
   - `GiftCardProvider`: Enum for supported providers (Amazon, Starbucks, Target, Walmart, Visa)
   - `GiftCardOption`: Model for available gift card denominations and point costs
   - `GiftCardRedemption`: Model for tracking redemption transactions
   - `RedemptionRequest`: Model for redemption requests

2. **Points System**
   - Conversion rate: 1 volunteer hour = 10 points
   - Points are calculated from total volunteer hours
   - Points balance considers previous redemptions

3. **New API Endpoints**
   - `GET /gift-cards/options` - List available gift card options
   - `GET /volunteers/{contact_id}/points` - Get volunteer's points balance
   - `POST /gift-cards/redeem` - Redeem points for a gift card
   - `GET /volunteers/{contact_id}/redemptions` - Get volunteer's redemption history
   - `GET /gift-cards/redemptions` - Admin endpoint for all redemptions

4. **Gift Card Options**
   - Amazon: $25 (250 points), $50 (500 points)
   - Starbucks: $10 (100 points), $25 (250 points)
   - Target: $25 (250 points)
   - Walmart: $25 (250 points)
   - Visa: $50 (500 points)

### Frontend Components (React)
1. **GiftCardStore Component**
   - Displays available gift card options in a grid layout
   - Shows volunteer's points balance and available points
   - Interactive redemption with real-time validation
   - Redemption history display with codes
   - Responsive design with immersive styling

2. **App Integration**
   - Toggle button to switch between volunteer card and gift card store
   - Integrated with existing volunteer lookup system
   - Maintains existing UI/UX patterns

### Enhanced Volunteer Data
- Extended `VolunteerAggregate` model to include points information
- Points calculation integrated into volunteer data aggregation
- Real-time points balance updates after redemptions

## Key Implementation Details

### Points Calculation Logic
```python
def calculate_volunteer_points(hours: float) -> int:
    return int(hours * 10)  # 1 hour = 10 points
```

### Mock Gift Card Generation
For demonstration purposes, the system generates mock gift card codes with provider-specific prefixes:
- AMZ-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX (Amazon)
- SBX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX (Starbucks)
- TGT-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX (Target)
- etc.

### Data Storage
Currently uses in-memory storage for gift card redemptions. In production, this should be replaced with a proper database system.

### Error Handling
- Insufficient points validation
- Volunteer not found handling
- Invalid gift card option handling
- Network error handling in frontend

## UI/UX Features
- **Immersive Design**: Matches existing volunteer card aesthetic
- **Real-time Updates**: Points balance updates immediately after redemption
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading states, success/error messages
- **Responsive Layout**: Grid-based gift card display
- **Provider Branding**: Color-coded provider logos and styling
- **Redemption History**: Shows past redemptions with codes

## Usage Flow
1. Volunteer searches and finds their card
2. Clicks the gift card store toggle button (üéÅ)
3. Views available gift cards and their points balance
4. Selects a gift card to redeem
5. Confirms redemption if they have sufficient points
6. Receives gift card code immediately
7. Can view redemption history

## Technical Considerations
- **Scalability**: In-memory storage should be replaced with database
- **Security**: Gift card codes should be encrypted/secured
- **Integration**: Real gift card provider APIs should replace mock generation
- **Validation**: Additional validation for redemption limits/rules
- **Analytics**: Track redemption patterns and popular gift cards

## Files Modified/Created
- `app/main.py` - Backend API extensions
- `volunteer-tracker/src/components/GiftCardStore.jsx` - New component
- `volunteer-tracker/src/App.jsx` - Integration updates
- `volunteer-tracker/src/index.css` - Styling additions

This implementation provides a complete foundation for a gift card redemption system that can be extended with real provider integrations, persistent storage, and additional business logic as needed.
